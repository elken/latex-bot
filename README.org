* Setup
** Install
Depends on the following tools:
- tectonic
- imagemagick
- poppler-utils
Install them through the package manager of whatever OS the bot runs on.

** Run
Run the latest uberjar, specifying the required keys through the environment:
- =TOKEN=: The access token for the bot
- =GUILD_ID=: The ID of the guild to run the command in
- =APPLICATION_ID=: The ID of the application (needed to register the commands)

* Usage
Simply invoke =/latex-image= from the associated guild passing the latex as the first =input= argument, then any needed packages as the optional second argument as a comma-separated list
